# Correspondent Commerce

This mod adds two items, and several new recipes involving them, to facilitate easier acquisition of resources in your world. It's heavily inspired by Equivalent Exchange.

## But what does it *do*?

Vanilla magma cubes will, very rarely, drop Rubedo Shards, and nine of them can be combined into a Rubedo Stone. Excess Shards may be used as potent fuel (can smelt 64 items).

The Rubedo Stone is capable of transmuting things into other things if crafted together with certain items, like 4 iron into 1 gold, that sort of thing.

It may at some point have a max number of uses before it disappears, for a slightly less overpowered experience, but, I'm still a novice, so I decided to forgo that for now.
